            <h2> The Magic of Glowing Creatures </h2>
            <p> Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called bioluminescence.
                It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light.
                It’s like nature’s version of neon lights! </p>
            <p> Here’s how it works: </p>
            <ol>
                <li> A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen. </li>
                <li> An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process. </li>
                <li> Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “cold light.” </li>
            </ol>

                    <li> Fireflies: They flash to talk to each other and attract mates </li>
                    <li> Deep-sea fish: They use it to scare predators or lure prey. </li>
                    <li> Fungi and plants: Some even glow to attract bugs or spread spores! </li>
